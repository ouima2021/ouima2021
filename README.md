Hello! My name is Ouima (she/her). I am currently completing a software bootcamp type of program called LaunchCode. Over the past several months I have learned so much about JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot and more! It's all very exciting and challenging, but I am up for it. I look forward to learning more languages as well as becoming expert-level in the languages that I am now familiar with. 

Welcome!
